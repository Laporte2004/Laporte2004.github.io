    <h1>Poème que j'aime: Par Robert Frost</h1>
    <p><center><strong>The Road Not Taken</strong>
<br>
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
<br>
And sorry I could not travel both
<br>
And be one traveler, long I stood
<br>
And looked down one as far as I could
<br>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
<br>
Then took the other, as just as fair,
<br>
And having perhaps the better claim
<br>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
<br>
Though as for that the passing there
<br>
Had worn them really about the same,
<br>
And both that morning equally lay
<br>
In leaves no step had trodden black.
<br>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
<br>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
<br>
I doubted if I should ever come back.
<br>
I shall be telling this with a sigh
<br>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
<br>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-
<br>
I took the one less traveled by,
<br>
And that has made all the difference.</center></p>
